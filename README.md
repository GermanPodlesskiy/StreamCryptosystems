The application implemented key generators: LFSR, Geffe, RC4. In the program, you can change the polynomials for key generation by replacing the static variables POLYNOMIAL_FIRST, POLYNOMIAL_SECOND, POLYNOMIAL_THIR, which are an array of int whose elements are the permissions for the arguments of the polynomial - 1. The constant OUTUP_ELEM is responsible for the number of output bits.
